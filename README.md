This is part of a real research project that resulted in the publication of the paper [Detecting the neural processes of lie generation with low-cost EEG: a preliminary study](./Garofalo_et_al_GNB_2020_paper_35.pdf).

This repo is messy. Many of the code snippets here are just drafts. It was not meant to be on github, but I'm uploading this to rehearse all those wonderful memories of working toghether with two great friends, Fabrizio and Francesco.
