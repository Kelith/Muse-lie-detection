This is part of a real research project that resulted in the publication of the paper [Detecting the neural processes of lie generation with low-cost EEG: a preliminary study](./Garofalo_et_al_GNB_2020_paper_35.pdf).   
 <br />
This repo is messy. Many of the code snippets here are just drafts. It was not meant to be on github, but I'm uploading this to rehearse all those wonderful memories of working toghether with two great friends, Fabrizio and Francesco.  

Disclaimer: The dataset is the original one (except for a couple of missing subjects). All people names are fake and the data has been deidentified in respect of the privacy of all subjects.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

There are many great README templates available on GitHub; however, I didn't find one that really suited my needs so I created this enhanced one. I want to create a README template so amazing that it'll be the last one you ever need -- I think this is it.

Here's why:
* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a README from scratch
* You should implement DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:

Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people have contributed to expanding this template!

Use the `BLANK_README.md` to get started.
